# Proxychains-setup

## Objective
A hands-on guide and configuration examples for using ProxyChains on Linux. This repo demonstrates how to route network traffic through multiple proxies, configure SOCKS5/HTTP proxies, and integrate ProxyChains with tools like PhoneInfoga and Nmap for ethical pentesting and OSINT.

### Skills Learned
- Network traffic routing and proxy chaining
- Anonymity and DNS leak prevention
- Linux system administration and configuration
- Integration with pentesting and reconnaissance tools

### Tools Used
- ProxyChains – For routing traffic through multiple proxies.
- Tor – Provides a reliable SOCKS5 proxy for anonymity.
